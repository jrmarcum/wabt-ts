A native TypeScript port of [WebAssembly/wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) — the
WebAssembly Binary Toolkit.

## Overview

wabt-ts provides the core wabt tooling as idiomatic TypeScript modules, distributed on
[JSR](https://jsr.io). It requires no compiled binary and runs natively on Deno (primary) and Bun
(secondary). It also adds `wasm2ts`, a new wasm-to-TypeScript ahead-of-time transpiler not present
in the original wabt.

### Tools

| Tool            | Description                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `wat2wasm`      | Translate WebAssembly text format (.wat) to binary (.wasm)         |
| `wasm2wat`      | Translate WebAssembly binary (.wasm) to text format (.wat)         |
| `wasm-validate` | Validate a WebAssembly binary (`--enable-<feature>` / `--enable-all`) |
| `wasm-objdump`  | Inspect sections and structure of a WebAssembly binary             |
| `wasm-strip`    | Strip custom sections (e.g. `name`) from a WebAssembly binary      |
| `wasm2ts`       | Transpile a WebAssembly binary to typed TypeScript (new — pending) |

## Spec conformance

Measured against the official [WebAssembly spec testsuite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite)
(257 files, 2120 modules) as of 2026-08-24:

|                                                      |                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Files the WAT parser accepts                         | **257 / 257**       |
| Modules that encode to wasm V8 accepts               | 2119 / 2120         |
| Modules V8 accepts that `wasmValidate` also accepts  | **2119 / 2119**     |
| `binary → wasm2wat → wat2wasm` byte-identical        | **2119 / 2119**     |
| Spec `assert_return` assertions the output satisfies | **23,077 / 23,077** |
| Modules the spec calls invalid that we reject        | **2683 / 2683**     |
| Binary the spec calls malformed that we reject       | **711 / 711**       |
| Text the spec calls malformed that we reject         | **1229 / 1229**     |
| Reader rejections whose message matches the spec      | 689 / 711           |
| Validator rejections whose message matches the spec   | 2446 / 2683         |
| Parser rejections whose message matches the spec      | 816 / 1229          |

The one module V8 does not accept is a 2^48-page `memory i64`, which exceeds V8's own
implementation limit at any faithful encoding. **Wasmtime**, the reference runtime, accepts what we
emit for it.

Cross-engine questions are settled against **V8, Wasmtime and Wasmer**, with Wasmtime as the
authority (`deno task engine-check <dir-of-wasm>`).

Round-trip fidelity is also **270 / 270** byte-identical over a 272-module corpus of real
WASI-targeting output from the [wasmtk](https://github.com/jrmarcum/wasmtk) compiler.

## What changed in v1.4.1

Published 2026-08-25. Fifteen user-visible fixes from a sustained audit of code that was already
green — lint clean, type-check clean, every conformance metric exhausted. Two of them emitted or
accepted **wrong output** in v1.4.0, and three change what the toolchain produces or says, so read
those before upgrading:

- **`wat2wasm` silently deleted an instruction** before `data.drop` / `elem.drop` — valid module,
  different answer. Fixed.
- **Every module now encodes ~3.2% smaller**, so output hashes move.
- **Error message text changed** in the parser and the binary reader.

Everything below is that release.

**All of these ship in v1.4.1.** Installing `@jrmarcum/wabt-ts` today gets them. Each entry names
the behaviour on **v1.4.0** so anyone still pinned there can see what they are exposed to, and
gives the workaround where one exists.

### `data.drop` / `elem.drop` deleted the instruction before them

**This one emitted wrong code.** A value-producing expression immediately before a `data.drop` or
`elem.drop` was swallowed by the parser and discarded. The resulting module is accepted by every
engine, runs, and computes a different answer than the source says — with no error, warning, or
diagnostic anywhere:

```wat
(module
  (memory 1) (data $d "xy")
  (global $g (mut i32) (i32.const 0))
  (func $bump (global.set $g (i32.const 7)))
  (func (export "run") (result i32)
    (call $bump)        ;; on v1.4.0 this call is DELETED
    (data.drop $d)
    (global.get $g)))
```

`run()` returns **0** on v1.4.0 and **7** after the fix. Both instructions take their segment as an
immediate and consume nothing from the stack; they were miscounted as taking one operand, so the
parser took a value that belonged to the surrounding code and had nowhere to put it.

If you compile WAT that places any value-producing expression directly before a `data.drop` or
`elem.drop`, check the output. The workaround on v1.4.0 is to reorder so the drop does not directly
follow such an expression.

### SIMD lane loads and stores were rejected on 64-bit memories

On a `(memory i64 …)`, `v128.load8_lane` / `v128.store8_lane` (and the 16/32/64-bit widths) required
an `i32` address instead of the `i64` the memory's index type calls for, so valid modules failed to
validate — and the reverse mistake was accepted:

```wat
;; rejected on v1.4.0, valid per spec and accepted by V8 and Wasmtime
(module (memory i64 1)
  (func (param v128) (result v128) (v128.load8_lane 0 (i64.const 0) (local.get 0))))
```

Other memory64 instructions — `i32.load`, `memory.fill`, `memory.grow`, `v128.load`, the atomics —
were unaffected; only the lane-indexed SIMD ops had it wrong.

### `table.get` with a computed index failed to encode

A `table.get` whose index operand referred to anything by name did not compile at all:

```wat
(module
  (table $t 4 funcref)
  (global $i i32 (i32.const 3))
  (func (drop (table.get $t (global.get $i)))))
```

```
<binary>:0x00000000: error: cannot encode module: binary writer:
unresolved name-var "$i" for var - run resolveNames before encoding
```

Name resolution treated `table.get` as having no operands, so the name inside its index was never
resolved and reached the binary writer as-is. It affects any named reference in that position —
`(global.get $i)`, `(call $f)`, and so on.

Unaffected, on v1.4.0 and after: a literal index (`(table.get $t (i32.const 0))`), a **numeric**
index expression (`(table.get $t (global.get 0))`), and every other table instruction, including
`table.set`. So the workaround on v1.4.0 is to write the inner reference numerically — `$i` is
global 0 in the module above:

```wat
(func (drop (table.get $t (global.get 0))))   ;; encodes on v1.4.0
```

### Signed LEB128 encoders reject out-of-range values

`encodeS32Leb128` and `encodeS64Leb128` silently wrapped a value that did not fit — 2^31 encoded as
-2^31 — where their unsigned counterparts already threw. They now throw `RangeError` too.

This is not reachable from `wat2wasm`: the text parser normalises and range-checks integer literals
before they reach the encoder. It only affects code that builds IR by hand and calls `writeBinaryIr`
directly, which previously got back the encoding of a different value.

### The validator accepted twelve invalid GC module shapes

`wasmValidate` returned a clean verdict on twelve kinds of module that no engine will load — V8 and
Wasmtime both reject all of them. If you validate before shipping, you were told these were fine:

```wat
;; accepted on v1.4.0; rejected by every engine
(module (func (param funcref) (result i32) (ref.test (ref null any) (local.get 0))))
(module (func (param anyref)  (result i32) (i31.get_s (local.get 0))))
(module (func (param i64) (result i31ref)  (ref.i31 (local.get 0))))
(module (type $s (struct (field i8)))
  (func (param (ref $s)) (result i32) (struct.get $s 0 (local.get 0))))
```

The full set: `ref.test` / `ref.cast` against a type from an unrelated hierarchy; `array.len` on
something that is not an array; `ref.i31`, `i31.get_s` / `i31.get_u`, `ref.is_null` and
`ref.as_non_null` given an operand of the wrong type; and `struct.get` / `array.get` using the
wrong signedness form for the field — `_s` / `_u` are valid only on a packed `i8` / `i16` field and
required there, while the plain spelling is valid only on an unpacked one.

Casting **within** a hierarchy is unaffected in both directions — narrowing `anyref` to a concrete
struct type and widening a concrete type back to `(ref null any)` are both still valid, as the spec
requires.

### `rethrow` with no enclosing catch validated

`wasmValidate` accepted `rethrow` naming a `block`, a `loop`, or nothing at all. This affects only
the superseded legacy exception-handling proposal, which neither Wasmtime nor Wasmer will execute
in any case.

### Malformed input crashed four of the published tools

`wasm2wat`, `wasm-validate`, `wasm-objdump` and `wasm-strip` document a
`{ errors, result }` contract, and threw an uncaught `RangeError` instead on
truncated or corrupt input — exactly the input a tool like this exists to be
pointed at. They now report the failure through `errors` as documented.

`/compat`'s `toBinary` likewise threw the binary writer's raw internal string.
It now throws an error that names itself, and the documentation says that it
throws.

### The CLI shims printed a stack trace for a mistyped filename

```
deno run -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/wasm-validate typo.wasm
```

dumped Deno internals plus absolute paths from our own source tree. All five
CLIs now print one line and exit 1 — which also stops local paths leaking into
whatever you paste into a bug report.

### A malformed memory alignment was silently repaired

A load or store whose alignment exponent exceeded what the opcode allows is
malformed, and the reader wrapped it into range instead of rejecting it — so
`wasm2wat` followed by `wat2wasm` turned a module the spec calls invalid into a
valid, different one. It is now rejected.

### A truncated type section decoded to a different module

A binary whose type-section count outran its actual entries stopped decoding
silently and reported success, so `wasm2wat` disassembled it as though the
missing types had never been declared and `wasm-validate` called it valid. Both
now reject it, as V8 does.

### The validator accepted unloadable subtyping graphs

`wasmValidate` accepted a GC module whose subtyping chain was deeper than the
63 levels the proposal permits, and one whose supertype declarations formed a
cycle (`$a <: $b <: $a`). Neither V8 nor Wasmtime will load either.

### `applyNames` left most expression kinds unnamed

The exported `applyNames` pass walked 37 of 87 expression kinds, so names were
applied inconsistently across a module — a name inside, say, an `if` condition
or a `try_table` handler was left as a raw index. This affects only callers
using `applyNames` directly; `/compat`'s `applyNames()` goes through
`generateNames` and was never affected.

### `wasm-strip` no longer moves the custom sections it keeps

Custom sections may appear anywhere in a module, and the encoder wrote them all
in one block at the end. So stripping *some* of them relocated the rest:

```
before:  wasm-strip --sections bloat  →  removes "bloat", moves everything else to the end
now:     removes "bloat", every other custom section stays where it was
```

This matters for sections whose position carries meaning. The dynamic-linking
convention requires `dylink.0` to be the **first** section; stripping debug info
from such a module previously produced something a dynamic linker would not
load.

Stripping everything — the default, with no `sections` argument — was never
affected, and still returns exactly the module minus its custom sections.

### Every module now encodes 3.2% smaller

Section sizes are not known until the section body has been written, so the
encoder reserved the maximum width for them — 5 bytes — and then wrote the size
into that reservation without collapsing it. Every section header in every
binary was therefore 4 bytes longer than it needed to be.

The sizes are now encoded minimally. On the 272-module WASI corpus this project
tests against, total output went from 628,201 to 607,845 bytes. Modules remain
valid and semantically identical — only the encoding is smaller — and the
encoder can now reproduce a minimally-encoded input byte-for-byte, which it
could not before.

**If you compare output hashes, they will change.**

### A misspelled instruction now says which one

A typo'd or nonexistent instruction — the most common mistake in hand-written
WAT — was reported by naming whatever token the parser had stopped on, which was
almost never the instruction:

```
(module (memory 1) (func (param i32) (result i32) (i32.load32 (local.get 0))))
```

```
before:  unexpected ( in function body
now:     unknown operator "i32.load32"
```

The linear form reported `unexpected Reserved in function body`, leaking an
internal token-class name; a typo inside a `block` reported `expected ), got (`.
All of them now name the operator, using the wording the spec uses.

Accept/reject is unchanged — these inputs were always rejected. **If you match
on error strings, this is a text change.**

### Decoder error messages now use the spec's wording

Error text only — every entrypoint accepts and rejects exactly the same inputs.
The binary reader's diagnostics were compared against the error each
`assert_malformed` case in the spec testsuite says it should produce, and 70 of
711 did not match; 5 do not now.

Two were wrong rather than merely differently worded. A 4-byte file with a bad
magic number was reported as ending unexpectedly, because the version field was
read before the magic was compared. And the spec names two distinct LEB128
faults — `integer too large` (the value exceeds the width) and
`integer representation too long` (the encoding exceeds the byte count) — which
the decoders distinguished internally and then reported with one shared message.

**If you match on error strings, note that `LEB128 u32 overflow` and
`LEB128 sequence is truncated` no longer appear.** No documented behaviour
promised them.

### Not affected

The acceptance figures above are unchanged — every fix was re-measured against the full testsuite
and the WASI corpus, each time against a baseline with the change reverted, and each time
byte-identical. The validator and reader fixes reject **only** input that was already invalid or
malformed: all 449 engine-accepted spec modules still validate. No exported type changes.

Three things do change beyond a verdict. The `data.drop` / `elem.drop` case above changes **emitted
output**, because the previous output was wrong code. **Every** module's encoding changes — it gets
smaller — from the minimal section-size fix. And error **message text** changes in the parser and
the binary reader. The last two are worth reading if you compare output hashes or match on error
strings.

The last three rows are new and are the only figures here not at ceiling. They grade our error
MESSAGES rather than our verdicts, against the error text the spec testsuite says each rejected
input should produce — for the binary reader, the validator, and the text parser respectively.

They measure **agreement with the reference implementation, not quality**, and the gap is not a
defect list. Most of the parser's remainder is inputs like `(i32.const 0x)`, which the spec calls
`unknown operator` because its lexer reserves the token; we say `expected i32 constant`, which is
the more useful message. We are not going to close that gap by making it worse.

## Breaking change since v1.3.5

`Limits.initial` and `Limits.max` are **`bigint`**, not `number`, and
`Limits.pageSize` is now **`Limits.pageSizeLog2`**.

The fields are u64 for a 64-bit memory or table, and a JS number is exact only to 2^53 — so
`(table i64 0 0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff funcref)`, which the spec calls valid, was silently rounded and
could not be encoded. A consumer that reads them as numbers gets a compile error at the site that
has to handle the wider range; convert with `Number(...)` at your own boundary if you know the
value fits.

`pageSizeLog2` holds what the wire field holds — the exponent — where `pageSize` was documented as
bytes but carried the raw value, so a decoded 64 KiB memory read as `pageSize = 16`. Omitted means
the standard 64 KiB page.

### The validator now enforces `features`

Nine proposals used to be accepted no matter what the `Features` bag said — `gc`, `threads`,
`memory64`, `tailCall`, `exceptions`, `relaxedSimd`, `extendedConst`, `functionReferences` and
`wideArithmetic`. Switching one off did nothing.

They are enforced now, for types as well as instructions. **`defaultFeatures()` disables all nine**,
so a caller that relied on the old behaviour has to ask for what it uses:

```typescript
import { allFeatures, defaultFeatures } from 'jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts';

validateModule(module, errors, { features: allFeatures() }); // accept everything
validateModule(module, errors, { features: { ...defaultFeatures(), gc: true } }); // or be specific
```

`wasm-validate` gained matching flags — `--enable-<feature>`, `--disable-<feature>` and
`--enable-all`, hyphenated the way wabt spells them (`--enable-tail-call`). An unrecognised flag
prints the list.

## Runtime compatibility

| Runtime        | Library API | CLI entry points        |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| **Deno**       | ✅          | ✅                      |
| **Bun**        | ✅          | — (use the library API) |
| **Node** (18+) | ✅          | —                       |
| **Browser**    | ✅          | —                       |

The library functions (`wat2wasm`, `wasm2wat`, `wasmValidate`, `wasmObjdump`, `wasmStrip`,
`parseWatModule`, `readBinaryIr`, `writeBinaryIr`, `writeWatModule`, `validateModule`, the IR types,
the `/compat` facade, etc.) use only standard Web platform APIs — `TextEncoder` / `TextDecoder`,
`DataView`, typed arrays, `Map` / `Set`, `WebAssembly` — and work unmodified in every modern
runtime. The CLI shims (`if (import.meta.main)` blocks inside each `src/tools/*.ts` entry point) use
`Deno.args` / `Deno.readFile` etc. and are exercised by
`deno run -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/wat2wasm input.wat …`; other runtimes import the library function
directly.

## Usage

### As a library (Deno)

```typescript
import { wasm2wat, wat2wasm } from 'jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts';
```

### As a library (Bun)

```sh
bunx jsr add @jrmarcum/wabt-ts
```

```typescript
import { wasm2wat, wat2wasm } from '@jrmarcum/wabt-ts';
```

### Run tools remotely via Deno

```sh
deno run -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/wat2wasm input.wat -o output.wasm
deno run -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/wasm2wat input.wasm
deno run -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/wasm-validate input.wasm
deno run -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/wasm-objdump input.wasm
deno run -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/wasm-strip input.wasm -o stripped.wasm
deno run -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/wasm2ts input.wasm -o output.ts
```

### Drop-in `npm:wabt` replacement via `/compat`

If you have code written against [`npm:wabt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wabt) (libwabt.js),
`wabt-ts/compat` provides the same async-factory API. Add an import-map entry:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "wabt": "jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts@^1.2.1/compat"
  }
}
```

…and your existing `import wabt from "wabt"` code compiles unchanged:

```typescript
import wabt from 'wabt';

const w = await wabt();
const m = w.parseWat('input.wat', source, { enable_all: true, exceptions: true });
const { buffer } = m.toBinary({});
m.destroy();

const m2 = w.readWasm(buffer, { readDebugNames: true });
const wat = m2.toText({ foldExprs: false, inlineExport: false });
m2.destroy();
```

Error semantics match upstream: `parseWat` and `readWasm` throw on failure with the formatted error
list as the message. `destroy()` is idempotent. See [src/api/wabt-compat.ts](src/api/wabt-compat.ts)
for the full surface.

## API (Phases 1–6)

### High-level tool functions

```typescript
import { wasm2wat, wasmObjdump, wasmStrip, wasmValidate, wat2wasm } from 'jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts';

// WAT text → wasm binary
const { binary, errors, result } = wat2wasm(`(module)`, { filename: 'input.wat' });

// wasm binary → WAT text
const { text } = wasm2wat(binary);

// validate
const { errors: errs, result: ok } = wasmValidate(binary);

// section dump
const { text: dump } = wasmObjdump(binary, { details: true });

// strip all custom sections (e.g. name section)
const { binary: stripped } = wasmStrip(binary);
```

### Low-level pipeline (IR access)

```typescript
import {
  constF32,
  constF64,
  constI32,
  constI64,
  LexerSource, // wrap a string or Uint8Array for the parser
  // IR constructors
  makeModule,
  parseWastScript, // (src: string) → { script: WastScript; errors: WabtError[] }
  // WAT parser — text → IR
  parseWatModule, // (src: string) → { module: Module; errors: WabtError[] }
  // Binary reader/writer — binary ↔ IR
  readBinaryIr, // (bytes: Uint8Array, errors, opts?) → Module
  // Validator
  validateModule, // (module: Module, errors: ErrorList, opts?) → Result
  varIndex,
  varName,
  writeBinaryIr, // (module: Module) → Uint8Array
  // WAT writer — IR → text
  writeWatModule, // (module: Module, opts?) → string
} from 'jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts';
```

### Parse WAT text to IR

```typescript
import { parseWatModule } from 'jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts';

const { module, errors } = parseWatModule(`
  (module
    (func $add (export "add") (param i32 i32) (result i32)
      local.get 0
      local.get 1
      i32.add)
  )
`);
```

### Binary round-trip

```typescript
import { makeErrorList, readBinaryIr, writeBinaryIr, writeWatModule } from 'jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts';

const bytes = await Deno.readFile('module.wasm');
const errors = makeErrorList();
const module = readBinaryIr(bytes, errors);

// IR → WAT text
const wat = writeWatModule(module);

// IR → binary (round-trip)
const roundTripped = writeBinaryIr(module);
```

### Validate a module

```typescript
import {
  allFeatures,
  formatErrors,
  hasErrors,
  makeErrorList,
  readBinaryIr,
  validateModule,
} from 'jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts';

const bytes = await Deno.readFile('module.wasm');
const errors = makeErrorList();
const module = readBinaryIr(bytes, errors);
validateModule(module, errors, { features: allFeatures() });

if (hasErrors(errors)) {
  console.error(formatErrors(errors));
} else {
  console.log('module is valid');
}
```

The `features` argument is not optional in practice: the default set disables GC, threads,
memory64, tail calls and exception handling, so omitting it rejects most modern wasm. See
[the validator now enforces `features`](#the-validator-now-enforces-features).

## Development

**Requirements:** [Deno](https://deno.land/) v2+

```sh
# Type-check
deno task check

# Run tests
deno task test

# Lint / format
deno lint
deno fmt

# Bundle of what CI runs (check + test)
deno task ci

# Dry-run the JSR publish manifest (no upload)
deno task publish:dry
```

Tests use `@std/testing/bdd` from JSR, which is compatible with both `deno test` and `bun test`.

No build step is required — JSR publishes TypeScript source directly.

## Publishing

The package is published to [JSR](https://jsr.io/@jrmarcum/wabt-ts) with
[OIDC provenance](https://docs.jsr.io/publishing-packages#publishing-from-github-actions) via GitHub
Actions. The flow is **tag-driven** — never run `deno publish` from a workstation, since that would
publish without provenance.

1. Bump `version` in [deno.json](deno.json).
2. Commit on `main`.
3. Trigger the release by pushing a matching tag:

   ```sh
   deno task publish
   ```

   This runs [scripts/publish.ts](scripts/publish.ts), which refuses if the working tree is dirty or
   the tag already exists, then creates and pushes the `v<version>` tag.

4. The [Publish workflow](.github/workflows/publish.yml) fires on the tag push, verifies that the
   tag matches `deno.json`, type-checks, tests, then runs `deno publish` inside the Actions runner.
   JSR detects the OIDC token and stamps the release with provenance automatically. The workflow
   then runs `gh release create --generate-notes` to create a matching
   [GitHub Release](https://github.com/jrmarcum/wabt-ts/releases).

## Roadmap

> This project is under active development. Phases 1–6 are complete and Phase 7 (binaryen bridge)
> covers ~45 expression kinds — every common compute / control-flow / memory / SIMD /
> reference-types / exception-handling case round-trips through the bridge to V8-validated wasm.

Phase 7 (binaryen bridge) covers MVP + Tier A (control flow, locals, globals) + Tier B (calls,
select, memory ops) + Tier C (reference types, SIMD lane ops + arithmetic + memory ops, exception
handling: tag defs + throw/throw_ref/try_table cases) + Tier D (memory + table exports, active +
passive data segments) + GC Tier 1 (`ref.eq` / `ref.i31` / `i31.get_s` / `i31.get_u` + 8 abstract
heap types: `anyref` / `eqref` / `i31ref` / `structref` / `arrayref` / `nullref` / `nullfuncref` /
`nullexternref`) + GC Tier 2 (`struct.new` / `struct.new_default` / `struct.get` / `struct.get_s` /
`struct.get_u` / `struct.set` plus `(type $name (struct (field ...) ...))` WAT syntax + packed `i8`
/ `i16` field types) + GC Tier 3 (`array.new` / `new_default` / `new_fixed` / `new_data` /
`new_elem` / `get` / `get_s` / `get_u` / `set` / `len`) + GC Tier 4 (`ref.test` / `ref.cast` with
`(ref [null] H)` heap-type immediates, abstract keywords + user-defined type indices) — full
module-level surface except element segments + start function. Bridge-side deferrals: typed-ref IR
refactor (`(ref $T)` parses but coarsens to `structref` in `Type[]` slots, so V8 round-trip is
blocked when typed-ref params appear); `br_on_cast` / `br_on_cast_fail` (opcodes wired, no IR yet);
upstream binaryen-ts gaps — `ref.as_non_null` (no `makeRefAsNonNull` factory), plain `v128.load`
(encoder's `loadOpcode` has no V128 branch), tag imports + tag exports (no `addTagImport`;
`WasmExport.kind` lacks `"tag"`), element segments (no `addElement`), start function (no
`setStart`), multi-value `return` (no `makeTupleMake`). binaryen-ts is at v1.0.9. Phase 8
(`wasm2ts`) is deferred pending wasmtk QA/QC.

**wasmtk-driven hardening (v1.0.7 → v1.3.1).** The wasmtk integration test suite has surfaced a
stream of latent wabt-ts bugs that previous tests didn't exercise. Pattern: a new module shape
parses wrong, gets fixed at root cause in `src/`, regression test added under `tests/`. Recent
landings include f64/f32 constant integer literals (were being encoded as raw bit patterns producing
subnormals; v1.1.0), multi-value `return` (was dropping all but the first operand; v1.1.1),
`memarg.align` defaulting to byte 0 instead of opcode-natural (broke binaryen's optimizer and caused
runtime corruption; v1.1.1), ~95-entry SIMD opcode-name table drift fixed by regenerating from
upstream wabt `opcode.def` (v1.1.1), SIMD `replace_lane` second-operand + try_table `(catch ...)` +
bare-offset elem segments + legacy `(try (do ...))` syntax (v1.1.3), nested `(call ...)`
operand-order fix in folded form (v1.1.4), Phase 7 Tier D bridge expansion (memory + table exports,
active + passive data segments) plus Bug D — empty-folded ops like `(local.set $x)` / `(drop)` /
`(global.set $g)` / `(return)` / `(i32.store)` now consume operands from the surrounding stack
instead of getting `Nop` placeholders, unblocking wasic's multi-value receive idiom (v1.1.6), Bug F
— `br_if` with a folded f64 condition wrapping `global.get $name` no longer mis-resolves non-first
globals to index 0 (the Bug D stack-pad is now clamped to what's actually available, so optional
operands like `br_if`'s `value` slot stay untouched; v1.1.7), parser support for
`v128.const i8x16/i16x8/i32x4/i64x2/f32x4/f64x2 …` literal forms plus Phase 7 GC Tier 1 — `ref.eq` /
`ref.i31` / `i31.get_s` / `i31.get_u` + the 8 abstract heap types (`anyref`, `eqref`, `i31ref`,
`structref`, `arrayref`, `nullref`, `nullfuncref`, `nullexternref`) parse, encode, and round-trip
through the bridge (v1.1.9), Bug G — `call_indirect (type $name)` no longer mis-resolves named types
to index 0 (`resolveNames` was resolving the `table` var but skipping `typeVar`; critical for
wasic's higher-order array methods which compile to named-type `call_indirect` everywhere; v1.2.0),
the `/compat` subpath export mirroring `npm:wabt`'s async-factory API (v1.2.1), and GC Tiers 2–4 —
struct types + 6 struct instructions (v1.2.3), array types + 9 array instructions (v1.2.4),
`ref.test` / `ref.cast` with heap-type immediates (v1.2.5), and legacy exception handling —
`(try (do …) (catch $tag …) (catch_all …)? (delegate …)?)` now parses to a real `TryExpr` with full
try/catch/catch_all/delegate/end dispatch instead of being coerced to a `block` (the coercion
dropped the dispatch edges, so the catch handler's leading `local.set`s ran on an empty operand
stack and V8 rejected the binary); `rethrow` depth + catch-tag name resolution and a latent
`wasm2wat` catch-body double-emit were fixed alongside (v1.2.9 — unblocks wasic's TypeScript
try/catch/throw output), and a statement-ordering fix — a folded value-producing statement (most
importantly a void `call`, which the parser can't distinguish from a value-returning call without
the callee's signature) was pushed onto the operand stack and only flushed to the statement list at
the block's end, landing AFTER any statements that followed it in source order; so
`(call $f …) (return X)` sank the call past the `return` into dead code and its side effect never
ran. A new `pushStmt` helper drains the operand stack before committing each statement, preserving
source order (a general correctness fix for any `sideEffectingCall(); return X;` shape; v1.3.0 —
unblocks the wasmtk shared-heap stdlib track; same release removed 5 dead private methods surfaced
by a reference-count sweep), and a hex-float literal fix — `parseF32/F64LiteralBits` parsed
`LiteralType.Hexfloat` tokens with JavaScript's `parseFloat()`, which cannot read WAT hex-float
notation (`0x1.921fb54442d18p+2`) and returns `0`; so every hex-float constant (all of wasmtk's
merged `mathlib` polynomial coefficients, π, e, ln2) was encoded as `0`, making the merged `Math.*`
functions return garbage. The fix adds an explicit `parseHexFloatValue` reconstructor and routes
both the f32 and f64 hex-float cases through it (v1.3.1 — unblocks the wasmtk Phase 38 mathlib
suite). The full 272-file wasmtk WAT corpus is wired into the test suite at
[tests/wasmtk/](tests/wasmtk/), so future regressions land as named-file failures in CI. Each fix is
accompanied by a regression test under [tests/](tests/) and a commit message on the
[GitHub history](https://github.com/jrmarcum/wabt-ts/commits/main) that explains the root cause.

**Integration milestone (2026-05-28):** wasmtk's Phase 1 test suite now passes 38/38 against
`@jrmarcum/wabt-ts@1.1.8`. Subsequent releases (v1.1.9 → v1.3.1) continue the hardening loop and add
`/compat`, the four GC tiers, the JSR doc-quality + runtime-compatibility polish, the CI fmt-check +
lint-clean fix, the legacy exception-handling encoder fix (v1.2.9) that unblocks the wasmtk Phase 15
exception suite, the statement-ordering fix (v1.3.0) that stops a void `call` before a `(return …)`
from sinking into dead code, and the hex-float literal fix (v1.3.1) that stops hex-float constants
from being encoded as `0` — unblocking the wasmtk shared-heap stdlib track and the Phase 38 mathlib
suite.

**JSR doc-quality milestone (v1.2.7+):** Every package entrypoint carries an `@module` JSDoc header
(purpose + usage example + pipeline notes), and every exported symbol surfaced through
`src/index.ts` has JSDoc — 265 / 265 symbols documented. JSR's package score reads 100% on both the
"module docs in all entrypoints" and "docs for most symbols" axes.

**Migration milestone — `/compat` (v1.2.1):** wabt-ts exposes `jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts/compat`, a thin
facade over the wabt-ts pipeline that mirrors `npm:wabt`'s (libwabt.js) async-factory API. Once
consumers add an import-map entry — `"wabt": "jsr:@jrmarcum/wabt-ts@^1.2.1/compat"` — existing
`import wabt from "wabt"` source compiles unchanged. See the Usage section below.

**GC proposal completion (v1.1.9 → v1.2.5):** All four GC tiers ship as `~25` new instructions plus
struct/array heap-type definitions, packed `i8` / `i16` field types, and `(ref [null] H)` heap-type
immediates. Caveat: wabt-ts's flat `Type[]` representation for params/results/locals can't yet carry
heap-type indices for typed refs, so `(ref $T)` / `(ref null $T)` syntactic forms parse but coarsen
to `structref` in the binary output. Tier 2–4 tests therefore verify binary encoding (type-section
bytes, instruction opcodes, immediate resolution) rather than V8 round-trip. The proper fix —
`FuncSignature.params: ValueType[]` carrying concrete heap-type metadata — is the next significant
Phase 7 piece.
